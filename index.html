<h1>Alfredo Ruiz-Malca</h1>

<h2><b>peoms</b></h2>

<p>prideful negligence / fear from fate / juiced and depleted /<br>
 swept and somber / green and deleted / careful and corny /<br>
 gummed and beguiled / fed to starve / fled but not freed /<br>
 pickled and bled / keeled to a stop / grounded afloat /<br>
 March to July / spun and stopped / a silent whistle / /</p>

<p>iniquitous, posterity</p>

<p>dogma’s a bitch</p>

<p>If you think to work rather than work and think, you will stop to think, does thinking work?</p>

<p>There’s no good excuse for no good reason</p>

<p>fortune dazzles those who cannot blink</p>

<p>Write to think, speak to believe</p>
<br>
<p>burrowed down frows
seep underground
plushed down hearts
flower and spark
<br>
spells among trees
shower and empower
opened up wounds
sting from the booze
<br>
red stains the eye
partial moments
pain that flies
cowards that run
heroes that die
<br>
more to add
beds that gag
clean sheet mania
</p>
