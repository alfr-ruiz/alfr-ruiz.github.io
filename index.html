<h2>poor fredi's pontiac</h2>

<p>1. Dogma’s a bitch.</p>
<p>2. Fortune dazzles those who don't blink.</p>
<p>3. If you think to work rather than work and think, you will stop to think, does thinking work?</p>
<p>4. Place weight on thoughts so they may steep, then drink as you would your tea.</p>
<p>5. There’s no good excuse, for no good reason.</p>
<p>6. Write to think, speak to believe.</p>

<h3>fishing grounds</h3>

<pre>
you're not an audience you're the cast

maybe here I can finally figure stuff out
stuff that's hidden in the real world
that's really why I'm up here after all.

I am the fisherman and this stage is my net
I cast slowly, not disturbing our pond
by this I am fed.

<h3>how to tune a cello</h3>

<pre>
the 2 opponents- magic and darkness

where one exists

the other is in danger

and must leave.

darkness cannot directly contribute to the work;

the desire to overcome it

brings forth the magic.

the stronger the dark

the stronger the balancer.
</pre>

<h3>movin'</h3>

<pre>
hit top speed

hit your brakes

mean it

or you'll get lapped by a dog
</pre>
<br>

<h3>be known for no reason</h3>

<pre>
how do you do it?

you stir your cup of memories and dreams, hoping a formula that feels good comes up.

somehow, somewhere it does.

only you can feel it which makes it yours. 

your original thought. 

it kindles your soul. 

"maybe tonight is the night where i keep going" you think. 

you hold back tears from last year when you told yourself the same thing. 

make this string of thoughts worth it. 

try not to rock the boat. 

flatten the creases of your brain. 

move it along to its glorious destination, like an egg across a sea of squirrels. 

And dance with so much fucking grace because it's life or death.

<h3>paper city</h3>

<pre>
gold faced
summer winds
bouncing kid
remembered things

I drift in droll
stumbling

a stroll downtown
forgotten, unfound
tomorrow's promise
sundered, unbound

locked up and out
from colorless dye
found peace and rest
until you pried

a bloodless battle
to crown the mean
is this our damned
Anthropocene
</pre>


<h3>capital for commerce</h3>

<pre>
shrill croaks
pierce mountaintops
to the crying glade
and machinery

of all the horrid noises
nothing can compare
to warfare

soldiers in the sun
a charred glaze
written, ridden
like a lazy comedy
</pre>


<h3>a daily glimpse</h3>

<pre>
harrowed memories
cancelled and culled

drawn distorted
separate, dulled-

what happened here?

in a daily glimpse
I find myself
forced to wake
from this fugue state-
</pre>


<h3>failed societies</h3>

<pre>
egrets
cracking in the gale

whips of wind
raking in the wails

drop
and see yourselves free

gossamer
poised perfect on a tree

turn
face your family
</pre>


<h3>frail peruvian</h3>

<pre>
coral beams are raining
wooing, sustaining
moral reigns are straining
in mass campaigning

stop and listen
lose all other senses
pull apart
lift off

meet me at the station
bursting into place
you're your own creation
so don't be late

when the sky breaks
a bloody moon remains
pull the brakes
don't forget your place
</pre>


<h3>love song for 2</h3>

<pre>
we met at my horizon
danced until the sky bled blue
laughed until the moon shone through

but beneath the jokes and subtle hints
the thoughts we thought we had
were true
</pre>


<h3><i>*hehe*</i></h3>

<pre>
thunderclap
motion blur
glossy iris
time deferred
</pre>


<h3>trail mix</h3>

<pre>
paper planets
in a cartoon

poking holes
thru the sky

trying to leave
running dry

cherubs in the rear view
don't look down

the soundscape mutes
we've been found
</pre>


<h3>to preconcieve a kiss</h3>

<pre>
red eyes at daybreak
a lover on your lap
moonlight on the lake
new memories made

watch your hands
fumble the mind frame
don't let the ink dry
big pics let you down

lapping till you dribble
down the slipping court
divorce the crumbling sky 
isolation's stain

sublime dance
supine and trance
creates a fire
gone.
haywire.
</pre>


<h3>capital for commerce pt.2</h3>

<pre>
cobalt kites
weave and wave 
wordless meanings 
keep skies ablaze

gusts galore
jeapordizing views
turning fools 
into food
</pre>


<h3>silk unveiled</h3>

<pre>
find the perfect word
don't let it slip away
to the great beyond
try another day

free and timeless
at the moment of impact
a curious intersection
aware and away

slip into your present
then give it away
and while you neck your pillow
greet ennui again

the devil's grace is kind
expensive to taste
it sizzles at the graze
then becomes plain
</pre>


<h3>sanguine-dappled walls</h3>

<pre>
a few drip drops
cascade the tangle tree

a monarch
with his monarchy 

bouncing blossoms,
dancing daffies

forever staring,
vapidly
</pre>
