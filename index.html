<h2>poor fredi's pontiac</h2>

<p>1. Dogma’s a bitch.</p>
<p>2. Fortune dazzles those who don't blink.</p>
<p>3. If you think to work rather than work and think, you will stop to think, does thinking work?</p>
<p>4. Place weight on thoughts so they may steep, then drink as you would your tea.</p>
<p>5. There’s no good excuse, for no good reason.</p>
<p>6. Write to think, speak to believe.</p>

<h3>fishing grounds</h3>

<pre>
you're not an audience you're the cast

maybe here I can finally figure stuff out
stuff that's hidden in the real world
that's really why I'm up here after all.

I am the fisherman and this stage is my net
I cast slowly, not disturbing our pond
by this I am fed.

<h3>how to tune a cello</h3>

<pre>
the 2 opponents- magic and darkness

where one exists

the other is in danger

and must leave.

darkness cannot directly contribute to the work;

the desire to overcome it

brings forth the magic.

the stronger the dark

the stronger the balancer.

<h3>movin'</h3>

<pre>
hit top speed

hit your brakes

mean it

or you'll get lapped by a dog
</pre>
<br>
be known for no reason
<h3></h3>

<pre>
how do you do it? you stir your cup of memories and dreams, hoping a formula that feels good comes up. somehow, somewhere it does. only you can feel it which makes it yours. your original thought. it kindles your soul. "maybe tonight is the night where i keep going" you think. you hold back tears from last year when you told yourself the same thing. make this string of thoughts worth it. try not to rock the boat, flatten the creases of your brain. move it along to its glorious destination, like an egg across a sea of squirrels. And dance with so much fucking grace because it's life or death.
