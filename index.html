<h2>poor fredi's pontiac</h2>

<p>1. Dogma’s a bitch.</p>
<p>2. Fortune dazzles those who don't blink.</p>
<p>3. If you think to work rather than work and think, you will stop to think, does thinking work?</p>
<p>4. Place weight on thoughts so they may steep, then drink as you would your tea.</p>
<p>5. There’s no good excuse, for no good reason.</p>
<p>6. Write to think, speak to believe.</p>

<h2>poems</h2>

<h3>time divide</h3>

<pre>
those chopped-in-half buildings
abandoned pools
leaf-ridden tools

upheveled roots
spindled, split branches

welded shut boulder
split turned shoulder;

when your sobs are fabled
and we get along

the moral here
is double-pronged
</pre>
<br>

<h3>fishing grounds</h3>

<pre>
you're not an audience you're the cast

maybe here I can finally figure stuff out
stuff that's hidden in the real world
that's really why I'm up here after all.

I am the fisherman and this stage is my net
I cast slowly, not disturbing our pond
by this I am fed.
</pre>

<h3>how to tune a cello</h3>

<pre>
the 2 opponents- magic and darkness

where one exists

the other is in danger

and must leave.

darkness cannot directly contribute to the work-

the desire to overcome it,

brings forth the magic

the stronger the dark

the stronger the balancer.
</pre>
<br>

<h3>movin'</h3>

<pre>
hit top speed

slam your brakes

mean it

or you'll get lapped by a dog
</pre>
