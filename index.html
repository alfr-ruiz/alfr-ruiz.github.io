<h1>Alfredo Ruiz-Malca</h1>

<h2><b>of words and such</b></h2>

<p>dogma’s a bitch</p>

<p>If you think to work rather than work and think,<br>
you will stop to think, does thinking work?</p>

<p>There’s no good excuse for no good reason</p>

<p>fortune dazzles those who cannot blink</p>

<p>Write to think, speak to believe</p>

<pre>
burrowed down frows
seep underground
plushed down hearts
flower and spark

spells among trees
shower and empower
opened up wounds
sting from the booze

red stains the eye
partial moments
pain that flies
cowards that run
heroes that die

more to add
beds that gag
clean sheet mania
