"It is generally agreed to be folly to hazard the loss of a friend rather than to lose a jest. But few consider how easily a friend may be thus lost. Depending on the known regard their friends have for them, jesters take more freedom with friends than they would dare to do with others, little thinking how much deeper we are wounded by an affront from one we love."
