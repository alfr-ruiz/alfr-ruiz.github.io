<h2>poor fredi's pontiac</h2>

<p>1. Dogma’s a bitch.</p>
<p>2. Fortune dazzles those who don't blink.</p>
<p>3. If you think to work rather than work and think, you will stop to think, does thinking work?</p>
<p>4. Place weight on thoughts so they may steep, then drink as you would your tea.</p>
<p>5. There’s no good excuse, for no good reason.</p>
<p>6. Write to think, speak to believe.</p>

<h2>poems</h2>

<h3>time divide</h3>

<pre>
those chopped-in-half buildings
abandoned pools
leaf-ridden tools

upheveled roots
spindled, split branches

welded shut boulder
split turned shoulder;

when your sobs are fabled
and we get along

the moral here
is double-pronged
</pre>
<br>

<h3>fishing grounds</h3>

<pre>
you're not an audience you're the cast
maybe here I can finally figure stuff out
stuff that's hidden in the real world
that's really why I'm up here after all.

I am the fisherman and this stage is my net
I cast slowly as to not disturb our thought pond
I am fed and chastened by this collusion
And I am starving
Let's go 
</pre>

<h3>how to tune a cello</h3>
<br>

<pre>
the 2 opponents: magic and darkness
where one exists, the other is not safe and must therefore leave.
darkness cannot directly contribute to the work,
it is the intrinsic desire to overcome or lament darkness, that brings forth the magic
the stronger the dark, the stronger the balancer
</pre>
