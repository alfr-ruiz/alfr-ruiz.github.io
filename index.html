<h1>Alfredo Ruiz-Malca</h1>

<p>prideful negligence / fear from fate / juiced and depleted /
 swept and somber / green and deleted / careful and corny /
 gummed and beguiled / fed to starve / fled but not freed /
 pickled and bled / keeled to a stop / grounded afloat /
 March to July / spun and stopped / a silent whistle / /</p>

<p>iniquitous, posterity<p>
