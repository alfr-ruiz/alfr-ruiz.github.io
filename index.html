<h1>Alfredo Ruiz-Malca</h1>

<h2>Almanack</h2>

<p>1. Dogma’s a bitch.</p>
<p>2. Fortune dazzles those who don't blink.</p>
<p>3. If you think to work rather than work and think, you will stop to think, does thinking work?</p>
<p>4. Place weight on thoughts so they may steep, then drink as you would your tea.</p>
<p>5. There’s no good excuse, for no good reason.</p>
<p>6. Write to think, speak to believe.</p>

<h2>Poems</h2>

<pre>
those chopped-in-half buildings
abandoned pools
leaf-ridden tools

upheveled roots
spindled, split branches

welded shut boulder
split turned shoulder

when your sobs are fabled
and we get along

the moral here
Is double-pronged
</pre>
