<h1>Alfredo's Almanack</h1>

<h2><b>Of Words and Such</b></h2>

<p>If you think to work rather than work and think,<br>
you will stop to think, does thinking work?</p>

<p>There’s no good excuse, for no good reason.</p>

<p>Fortune dazzles those who don't blink.</p>

<p>Write to think, speak to believe.</p>

<p>Dogma’s a bitch.</p>
