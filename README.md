Portfolio to get me into a major recording studio.

To-Do:
1. externally host audio and video files using the Internet Archive
2. HTML to embed media files into home page
3. use Vanilla JS to create a custom GUI for the media player
4. JS for dynamic content loading & media lightbox
5. fix: at the home screen AND when returning to it, the address bar should only show the apex domain
