Portfolio to get me into a major recording studio.

To-Do:
1. externally host audio and video files using the Internet Archive
2. HTML to embed files into home page
3. use Vanilla JS to create a custom GUI for the media player
4. JS for dynamic content loading, page transitions, scrolling fx, media lightbox
5. fix: when clicking on logo to return home, address bar defaults to https://www.alfredorm.com/index.html instead of alfredorm.com
